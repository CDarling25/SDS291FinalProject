	abstract = {Media are one source for adolescent identity development and social identity gratifications. Nielsen viewing data across the 2014–2015 television season for adolescents ages 14–17 was used to examine racial and gender diversity in adolescent television exposure. Compared to U.S. Census data, mainstream shows underrepresent women, but the proportion of Black characters is roughly representative. Black adolescents watch more television than non-Black adolescents and, after taking this into account, shows popular with Black adolescents are more likely than shows popular with non-Black adolescents to exhibit racial diversity. In addition, shows popular with female adolescents are more likely than shows popular with males to exhibit gender diversity. These results support the idea that adolescents seek out media messages with characters that are members of their identity groups, possibly because the characters serve as tools for identity development and social identity gratifications.},

	abstract = {Purpose – A growing body of research demonstrates that diversity training can be successful in improving attitudes and behaviors towards ethnic minorities but, very little research focuses on the effects of diversity training on ethnic minorities' attitudes. Therefore, the purpose of the current paper is to examine ethnic differences in organizational attitudes as a function of offering diversity training. Design/methodology/approach – Using survey methodology, 186 students majoring in hotel and restaurant management that were part‐ or full‐time employees at a hospitality operation were requested to participate. Participants were forwarded an e‐mail with the link to the survey that contained the measures of interests, as well as demographic questions, control variables, and a debriefing statement. Findings – The results showed that offering diversity training at the workplace had a significant effect for ethnic minorities' job satisfaction, perceived workplace discrimination, and turnover intentions, but this effect was not found for majority‐member participants. Perceived workplace discrimination mediated the relationship between job satisfaction and turnover intentions. Research limitations/implications – This study provides support that diversity training is a tool that can have a positive impact on ethnic minority employees, while not negatively affecting Caucasian employees. Originality/value – Very little research examines why diversity training works. This research shows that by offering diversity training, organizations potentially send signals to their employees that a diverse workforce is important.},

	abstract = {This study examines the effects of age and gender on work-related subjective well-being, looking at job-related affective well-being and job satisfaction. Specifically, it investigates whether older women, who may be doubly disadvantaged in being old and being women, are victims of a "double jeopardy" effect. Self-reported survey-data were obtained from 446 adults employed full-time. The results of this study suggest that age seems to matter more than gender in the workplace, and that aging is associated with lower job-related well-being and higher job satisfaction. Although older women reported slightly lower job-related affective well-being than men, the decrease of subjective well-being with age impacts on both genders.},
