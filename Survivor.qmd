## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

```{r}

survivor <- read_csv('eval.csv')
survivor <- survivor[-106, ]
survivor$age_adj <- survivor$age - 18
```

```{r}

# effect size = odds ratio = ad/bc. 11 out of 32 (96 players overall) POC players had positive attitude before. 11 out of 52 (89 players overall) POC players had positive attitude after
(11*41) / (11 * 21)
# 95% CI for odds ratio of odds of negative pre v. odds of negative post for POC = 0.727 to 5.241

```

```{r}
ggplot(data = survivor, 
       mapping = aes(x = as.factor(Attitude),
                     fill = as.factor(poc) )) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_wrap(~div_rules) + 
  labs(title = "Initial Attitudes of POC and White Players Pre- and Post- Implementation of Diversity Casting Rules on CBS's Survivor",
         fill = "POC Status"
       ) +
  scale_fill_discrete(labels = c("White", "POC")) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels=c("Negative", "Positive")) +
  xlab("Attitude") +
  ylab("Count")

# summary table 
survivor |>
  group_by(div_rules) |>
  summarize(mean_compound_score = mean(`Compound Score`),
            mean_age = mean(age),
            number_of_players = n())
```

```{r}
emplogitplot1(Attitude ~ age, data = survivor, ngroups = 10)
```

We want the following models:

Model that measures how Attitude is explained by POC status and whether the Div_Rules were there, with the interaction term. This interaction term measures how the presence of div_rules interacts with the relationship between being poc and having a positive attitude.

Model that measures how Attitude is explained by POC status and whether the Div_Rules were there, with the interaction term, as well as age. This measures how the presence of div_rules interacts with the relationship between being poc and having a positive attitude after accounting for age.

Model that measures how Attitude is explained by POC status and whether the Div_Rules were there, with the interaction term, as well as age and gender. This measures how the presence of div_rules interacts with the relationship between being poc and having a positive attitude after accounting for age and gender.

```{r}
survivor$season <- as.factor(survivor$season)
survivor.lm <- glm(Attitude ~ poc * div_rules + season, data = survivor, family = "binomial")
summary(survivor.lm)
survivor.lm.1 <- glm(Attitude ~ poc * div_rules + age + season, data = survivor, family = "binomial")
summary(survivor.lm.1)
survivor.lm.2 <- glm(Attitude ~ poc * div_rules + age_adj + gender + season, data = survivor, family = "binomial")
summary(survivor.lm.2)
```

Do we want a model with race? We are not interested in breaking down by race, only POC status, but it seems sensible to have a model that measures how Attitude is explained by race status and whether the Div_Rules were there, with the interaction term, as well as age and gender. This measures how the presence of div_rules interacts with the relationship between being different races.
